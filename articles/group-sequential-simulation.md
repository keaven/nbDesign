# Group sequential design and simulation

```

This vignette demonstrates how to create a group sequential design for
negative binomial outcomes using
[`gsNBCalendar()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/gsNBCalendar.md)
and simulate the design to confirm design operating characteristics
using
[`nb_sim()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/nb_sim.md).

## Trial design parameters

We design a trial with the following characteristics:

- **Enrollment:** 12 months with a constant rate
- **Trial Duration:** 24 months
- **Analyses:**
  - Interim 1: 10 months
  - Interim 2: 18 months
  - Final: 24 months
- **Event Rates:**
  - Control: 0.125 events per month (1.5 per year)
  - Experimental: 0.0833 events per month (1.0 per year; rate ratio =
    0.67)
- **Dispersion:** 0.5
- **Power:** 90% (beta = 0.1)
- **Alpha:** 0.025 (one-sided) \# **event gap:** 20 days \# **dropout
  rate:** 5% at 1 year \# **max followup:** 12 months

### Sample size calculation

First, we calculate the required sample size for a fixed design using
the Zhu and Lakkis method:

``` r
# Sample size calculation
# Enrollment: constant rate over 12 months
# Trial duration: 24 months
event_gap_val <- 20 / 30.4375 # Minimum gap between events is 20 days (approx)

nb_ss <- sample_size_nbinom(
  lambda1 = 1.5 / 12, # Control event rate (per month)
  lambda2 = 1.0 / 12, # Experimental event rate (per month)
  dispersion = 0.5, # Overdispersion parameter
  power = 0.9, # 90% power
  alpha = 0.025, # One-sided alpha
  accrual_rate = 1, # This will be scaled to achieve the target power
  accrual_duration = 12, # 12 months enrollment
  trial_duration = 24, # 24 months trial
  max_followup = 12, # 12 months of follow-up per patient
  dropout_rate = -log(0.95) / 12, # 5% dropout rate at 1 year
  event_gap = event_gap_val,
  method = "zhu" # Zhu and Lakkis sample size method
)

# Print key results
message("Fixed design")

#> Sample size for negative binomial outcome
#> ==========================================
#> 
#> Method:          zhu
#> Sample size:     n1 = 182, n2 = 182, total = 364
#> Expected events: 414.1 (n1: 245.9, n2: 168.2)
#> Power: 90%, Alpha: 0.025 (1-sided)
#> Rates: control = 0.1250, treatment = 0.0833 (RR = 0.6667)
#> Dispersion: 0.5000, Avg exposure (calendar): 11.70
#> Avg exposure (at-risk): n1 = 10.81, n2 = 11.09
#> Event gap: 0.66
#> Dropout rate: 0.0043
#> Accrual: 12.0, Trial duration: 24.0
#> Max follow-up: 12.0
```

### Group sequential design

Now we convert this a group sequential design with 3 analyses after 10,
18 and 24 months. Note that the final analysis time must be the same as
for the fixed design. The relative enrollment rates will be increased to
increase the sample size as with standard group sequential design
theory. We specify `usTime = c(0.1, 0.18, 1)` which along with the
[`sfLinear()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesign/reference/sfLinear.html)
spending function will spend 10%, 18% and 100% of the cumulative
$\alpha$ at the 3 planned analyses regardless of the observed
statistical information at each analysis. The interim spending is
intended to achieve a nominal p-value of 0.0025 (one-sided) at both
interim analyses.

``` r
# Analysis times (in months)
analysis_times <- c(10, 18, 24)

# Create group sequential design with integer sample sizes
gs_nb <- gsNBCalendar(
  x = nb_ss, # Input fixed design for negative binomial
  k = 3, # 3 analyses
  test.type = 4, # Two-sided asymmetric, non-binding futility
  sfu = sfLinear, # Linear spending function for upper bound
  sfupar = c(.5, .5), # Identity function
  sfl = sfHSD, # HSD spending for lower bound
  sflpar = -8, # Conservative futility bound
  usTime = c(.1, .18, 1), # Upper spending timing
  lsTime = NULL, # Spending based on information
  analysis_times = analysis_times # Calendar times in months
) |> gsDesignNB::toInteger() # Round to integer sample size
```

## Simulation study

We now simulate 50 trials to evaluate the power of the group sequential
design assuming design parameters above are correct.

### Simulation setup

``` r
set.seed(42)
n_sims <- 50

# Enrollment rate (patients per month) to achieve target sample size
n_target <- ceiling(nb_ss$n_total)
enroll_rate_val <- n_target / 12 # All enrolled in 12 months

# Define enrollment
enroll_rate <- data.frame(
  rate = enroll_rate_val,
  duration = 12 # 12 months enrollment
)

# Define failure rates (with dispersion)
fail_rate <- data.frame(
  treatment = c("Control", "Experimental"),
  rate = c(1.5 / 12, 1.0 / 12),
  dispersion = c(0.5, 0.5)
)

# Dropout rate (5% at 1 year)
dropout_rate_val <- -log(0.95)
dropout_rate <- data.frame(
  treatment = c("Control", "Experimental"),
  rate = c(dropout_rate_val, dropout_rate_val),
  duration = c(100, 100) # Long duration
)

# Maximum follow-up (trial duration from enrollment start)
max_followup <- 12 # 12 months to match design
```

### Run simulations

We use
[`sim_gs_nbinom()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/sim_gs_nbinom.md)
to generate data and perform interim analyses, and
[`check_gs_bound()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/check_gs_bound.md)
to apply the group sequential boundaries.

``` r
# Simulate
sim_res <- sim_gs_nbinom(
  n_sims = n_sims,
  enroll_rate = enroll_rate,
  fail_rate = fail_rate,
  dropout_rate = dropout_rate,
  max_followup = max_followup,
  event_gap = event_gap_val,
  cuts = lapply(analysis_times, function(x) list(planned_calendar = x)),
  design = gs_nb,
  n_target = n_target
)

# Apply bounds
results <- check_gs_bound(
  sim_results = sim_res,
  design = gs_nb,
  info_scale = "blinded"
)
```

## Notes

This simulation demonstrates the basic workflow for group sequential
designs with negative binomial outcomes:

1.  **Sample size calculation** using
    [`sample_size_nbinom()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/sample_size_nbinom.md)
    for a fixed design
2.  **Group sequential design** using
    [`gsNBCalendar()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/gsNBCalendar.md)
    to add interim analyses
3.  **Simulation** using
    [`nb_sim()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/nb_sim.md)
    to generate trial data
4.  **Analysis** using
    [`cut_data_by_date()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/cut_data_by_date.md)
    and
    [`mutze_test()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/mutze_test.md)
    at each interim
5.  **Boundary checking** against the group sequential bounds

The `usTime = c(0.1, 0.2, 1)` specification provides conservative alpha
spending at early analyses, preserving most of the Type I error for
later analyses when more information is available.

With only 50 simulations, the estimated power has substantial Monte
Carlo error. For more precise estimates, increase `n_sims` to 1000 or
more.
