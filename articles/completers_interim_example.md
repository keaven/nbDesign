# Group Sequential Simulation with Completers Analysis

``` r
library(gsDesignNB)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(gt)
```

This vignette demonstrates how to simulate a group sequential design
where an interim analysis is conducted based on a specific number of
“completers” (subjects who have finished their follow-up).

## Simulation Setup

We define a trial with the following parameters:

- **Sample Size:** 200 patients.
- **Enrollment:** Recruited over 12 months.
- **Follow-up:** 2 years maximum follow-up per patient.
- **Interim Analysis:** Conducted when 40% of patients (80 subjects)
  have completed their 2-year follow-up. The interim analysis includes
  **only** these completers.
- **Final Analysis:** Conducted when all patients have completed
  follow-up (or dropped out). Includes all available data (completers
  and partial follow-up).

``` r
# Parameters
n_total <- 200
enroll_duration <- 12 # months
max_followup <- 24 # months (using months as time unit for clarity)

# Convert to years if rates are annual, but let's stick to consistent units.
# Let's say rates are per YEAR, so we convert time to years.
# Time unit: Year
n_total <- 200
enroll_duration <- 1 # 1 year
max_followup <- 2 # 2 years

enroll_rate <- data.frame(
  rate = n_total / enroll_duration, 
  duration = enroll_duration
)

fail_rate <- data.frame(
  treatment = c("Control", "Experimental"),
  rate = c(0.5, 0.35) # Events per year
)

dropout_rate <- data.frame(
  treatment = c("Control", "Experimental"),
  rate = c(0.05, 0.05),
  duration = c(100, 100)
)
```

## Simulation Loop

We will simulate 50 trials. For each trial, we perform the interim and
final analyses.

``` r
set.seed(2024)
n_sims <- 50
results <- data.frame(
  sim_id = integer(n_sims),
  interim_date = numeric(n_sims),
  interim_z = numeric(n_sims),
  interim_n = integer(n_sims),
  final_date = numeric(n_sims),
  final_z = numeric(n_sims),
  final_n = integer(n_sims)
)

# Target completers for interim (40%)
target_completers <- 0.4 * n_total

for (i in 1:n_sims) {
  # 1. Simulate Trial Data
  sim_data <- nb_sim(
    enroll_rate = enroll_rate,
    fail_rate = fail_rate,
    dropout_rate = dropout_rate,
    max_followup = max_followup,
    n = n_total
  )
  
  # 2. Interim Analysis (Completers Only)
  # Find date when target_completers is reached
  date_interim <- cut_date_for_completers(sim_data, target_completers)
  
  # Cut data for completers at this date
  data_interim <- cut_completers(sim_data, date_interim)
  
  # Analyze (Mütze Test)
  res_interim <- mutze_test(data_interim)
  # Extract Z-statistic
  z_interim <- res_interim$z
  
  # 3. Final Analysis (All Data)
  # Date is when last patient completes (or max follow-up reached)
  # For final analysis, we use all data collected up to the end of the study.
  # The end of the study is when the last patient reaches max_followup.
  date_final <- max(sim_data$calendar_time)
  
  # Cut data at final date (includes partial follow-up for dropouts, full for completers)
  data_final <- cut_data_by_date(sim_data, date_final)
  
  res_final <- mutze_test(data_final)
  z_final <- res_final$z
  
  # Store results
  results$sim_id[i] <- i
  results$interim_date[i] <- date_interim
  results$interim_z[i] <- z_interim
  results$interim_n[i] <- nrow(data_interim)
  results$final_date[i] <- date_final
  results$final_z[i] <- z_final
  results$final_n[i] <- nrow(data_final)
}
```

## Results Summary

We summarize the distribution of the test statistics (Z-scores) at the
interim and final analyses.

``` r
summary(results[, c("interim_date", "interim_z", "final_date", "final_z")])
#>   interim_date     interim_z         final_date       final_z       
#>  Min.   :2.335   Min.   :-3.5535   Min.   :2.826   Min.   :-4.2149  
#>  1st Qu.:2.410   1st Qu.:-1.6347   1st Qu.:2.924   1st Qu.:-2.7246  
#>  Median :2.440   Median :-1.2086   Median :2.986   Median :-2.0284  
#>  Mean   :2.443   Mean   :-1.2446   Mean   :2.988   Mean   :-2.1068  
#>  3rd Qu.:2.467   3rd Qu.:-0.7949   3rd Qu.:3.044   3rd Qu.:-1.3613  
#>  Max.   :2.578   Max.   : 0.9434   Max.   :3.166   Max.   :-0.5409
```

### Visualization

Comparison of Z-scores at Interim vs Final Analysis.

``` r
ggplot(results, aes(x = interim_z, y = final_z)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray") +
  labs(
    title = "Z-Scores: Interim vs Final Analysis",
    x = "Interim Z-Score (Completers Only)",
    y = "Final Z-Score (Full Data)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The plot shows the correlation between the interim statistic (based on
40% completers) and the final statistic.
