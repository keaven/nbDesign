Description: Provides tools for planning and simulating recurrent event trials
    with overdispersed count endpoints analyzed using negative binomial (or
    Poisson) rate models. Implements sample size and power calculations for
    fixed designs with variable accrual, dropout, maximum follow-up, and event
    gaps, including methods of Zhu and Lakkis (2014) <doi:10.1002/sim.5947> and
    Friede and Schmidli (2010) <doi:10.3414/ME09-02-0060>. Supports group
    sequential designs by adding calendar-time analysis schedules compatible
    with the 'gsDesign' package and by estimating blinded information at
    interim looks. Includes simulation utilities for recurrent events
    (including seasonal rates), interim data truncation, and Wald-based
    inference for treatment rate ratios.
