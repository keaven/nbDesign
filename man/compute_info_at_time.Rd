  analysis_time,
  accrual_rate,
  accrual_duration,
  lambda1,
  lambda2,
  dispersion,
  ratio = 1,
  dropout_rate = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{analysis_time}{The calendar time of the analysis.}

\item{accrual_rate}{The enrollment rate (subjects per time unit).}

\item{accrual_duration}{The duration of the enrollment period.}

\item{lambda1}{Event rate for group 1 (control).}

\item{lambda2}{Event rate for group 2 (treatment).}

\item{dispersion}{The negative binomial dispersion parameter.}

\item{ratio}{Allocation ratio (n2/n1). Default is 1.}

\item{dropout_rate}{Dropout rate (hazard rate). Default is 0.}

\item{event_gap}{Gap duration after each event during which no new events are counted.
Default is 0.}
}
\value{
The statistical information (inverse of variance) at the analysis time.
}
\description{
Computes the statistical information for the log rate ratio at a given
analysis time, accounting for staggered enrollment and varying exposure times.
