\usage{
blinded_ssr(
  data,
  ratio = 1,
  lambda1_planning,
  lambda2_planning,
  power = 0.8,
  alpha = 0.025,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the blinded interim data. Must include
columns \code{events} (number of events) and \code{tte} (total exposure/follow-up time).
This is typically the output of \code{\link[=cut_data_by_date]{cut_data_by_date()}}.}

\item{ratio}{Planned allocation ratio (experimental / control). Default is 1.}

\item{lambda1_planning}{Planned event rate for the control group used in original calculation.}

\item{lambda2_planning}{Planned event rate for the experimental group used in original calculation.}

\item{power}{Target power (1 - beta). Default is 0.8.}

\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level. Default is 0.025.}

\item{method}{Method for sample size recalculation. Currently "friede" (Friede & Schmidli 2010)
is implemented, which uses the blinded nuisance parameter estimates.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{n_total_unadjusted}{Original planned total sample size (based on planning parameters).}
\item{n_total_blinded}{Re-estimated total sample size using blinded estimates.}
\item{dispersion_blinded}{Estimated dispersion parameter (k) from blinded data.}
\item{lambda_blinded}{Estimated overall event rate from blinded data.}
\item{info_fraction}{Estimated information fraction at interim (blinded information / target information).}
\item{blinded_info}{Estimated statistical information from the blinded interim data.}
\item{target_info}{Target statistical information required for the planned power.}
}
}
\description{
Estimates the blinded dispersion and event rate from aggregated interim data
and calculates the required sample size to maintain power, assuming the
planned treatment effect holds. This function supports constant rates (Friede &
Schmidli 2010) and accommodates future extensions for time-varying rates
(Schneider et al. 2013) by using the exposure-adjusted rate.
