\usage{
sample_size_nbinom(
  lambda1,
  lambda2,
  dispersion,
  power = NULL,
  alpha = 0.025,
  sided = 1,
  ratio = 1,
  accrual_rate,
  accrual_duration,
  trial_duration,
  dropout_rate = 0,
  max_followup = NULL,
  event_gap = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lambda1}{Rate in group 1 (control).}

\item{lambda2}{Rate in group 2 (treatment).}

\item{dispersion}{Dispersion parameter \code{k} such that \eqn{\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \mu + k \mu^2}.
Note that this is equivalent to \code{1/size} in R's \code{\link[stats:NegBinomial]{stats::rnbinom()}} parameterization.}

\item{power}{Power of the test (1 - beta). Default is 0.9.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level. Default is 0.025.}

\item{sided}{One-sided or two-sided test. 1 for one-sided, 2 for two-sided. Default is 1.}

\item{ratio}{Allocation ratio n2/n1. Default is 1.}

\item{accrual_rate}{Vector of accrual rates (patients per unit time).}

\item{accrual_duration}{Vector of durations for each accrual rate. Must be same length
as \code{accrual_rate}.}

\item{trial_duration}{Total planned duration of the trial.}

\item{dropout_rate}{Dropout rate (hazard rate). Default is 0. Can be a vector of length 2.}

\item{max_followup}{Maximum follow-up time for any patient. Default is NULL (infinite).}

\item{event_gap}{Gap duration after each event during which no new events are counted.
Default is NULL (no gap). If provided, the effective event rate is reduced.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{sample_size_nbinom_result}, which is a list containing:
\describe{
\item{inputs}{Named list of the original function arguments.}
\item{n1}{Sample size for group 1}
\item{n2}{Sample size for group 2}
\item{n_total}{Total sample size}
\item{exposure}{Average exposure time used in calculation (calendar time). Vector of length 2.}
\item{exposure_at_risk_n1}{Average at-risk exposure time for group 1 (accounts for event gap)}
\item{exposure_at_risk_n2}{Average at-risk exposure time for group 2 (accounts for event gap)}
}
}
\description{
Computes the sample size for comparing two treatment groups assuming a negative
binomial distribution for the outcome.
