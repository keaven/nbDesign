  lambda1,
  lambda2,
  dispersion,
  power = NULL,

  sided = 1,
  exposure = NULL,
  ratio = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{lambda1}{Rate in group 1 (control).}

\item{lambda2}{Rate in group 2 (treatment).}

\item{dispersion}{Dispersion parameter \code{k} such that \eqn{Var(Y) = \mu + k \mu^2}.
Note that this is equivalent to \code{1/size} in R's \code{rnbinom} parameterization.}

\item{power}{Power of the test (1 - beta). Default is 0.9.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level. Default is 0.025.}

\item{sided}{One-sided or two-sided test. 1 for one-sided, 2 for two-sided. Default is 1.}

\item{exposure}{Duration of exposure. Default is 1. Ignored if \code{accrual_rate}
and related parameters are provided.}

\item{ratio}{Allocation ratio n2/n1. Default is 1.}

\item{accrual_rate}{Vector of accrual rates (patients per unit time). If provided,
\code{accrual_duration} and \code{trial_duration} must also be provided.}

\item{accrual_duration}{Vector of durations for each accrual rate. Must be same length
as \code{accrual_rate}.}

\item{trial_duration}{Total planned duration of the trial.}

\item{dropout_rate}{Dropout rate (hazard rate). Default is 0.}

\item{max_followup}{Maximum follow-up time for any patient. Default is NULL (infinite).}

\item{event_gap}{Gap duration after each event during which no new events are counted.
Default is NULL (no gap). If provided, the effective event rate is reduced.}

\item{method}{Method for sample size calculation. "zhu" for Zhu and Lakkis (2014),
"friede" for Friede and Schmidli (2010) / Mütze et al. (2018).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{n1}{Sample size for group 1}
\item{n2}{Sample size for group 2}
\item{n_total}{Total sample size}
\item{exposure}{Average exposure time used in calculation}
}
}
\description{
Computes the sample size for comparing two treatment groups assuming a negative
binomial distribution for the outcome.

# Calculate sample size for lambda1 = 0.5, lambda2 = 0.3, dispersion = 0.1

# Trial ends at month 12.
