\title{Simulate Recurrent Events with Fixed Follow-up}
\usage{
nb_sim(
  enroll_rate,
  fail_rate,
  dropout_rate = NULL,
  max_followup = NULL,
  n = NULL,
  block = c(rep("Control", 2), rep("Experimental", 2))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{enroll_rate}{A data frame with columns \code{rate} and \code{duration} defining
the piecewise constant enrollment rates.}

\item{fail_rate}{A data frame with columns \code{treatment} and \code{rate} defining
the exponential failure rate for each treatment group.}

\item{dropout_rate}{A data frame with columns \code{treatment}, \code{rate}, and \code{duration}
defining the piecewise constant dropout rates.}

\item{max_followup}{Numeric. Maximum duration of follow-up for each individual
(relative to their randomization time).}

\item{n}{Total sample size. If NULL, it is estimated from \code{enroll_rate}.
If provided, enrollment stops when \code{n} subjects are recruited.}

\item{block}{Block vector for treatment allocation. Default is
\code{c(rep("Control", 2), rep("Experimental", 2))}.
If NULL, simple randomization is used (treatments are assigned with equal probability).
If provided, it specifies the block structure, e.g., \code{c(rep("A", 2), rep("B", 2))}
assigns 2 to group A and 2 to group B in each block.}
}
\value{
A data frame (tibble) with columns:
\describe{
\item{id}{Subject identifier}
\item{treatment}{Treatment group}
\item{enroll_time}{Time of enrollment relative to trial start}
\item{tte}{Time to event or censoring relative to randomization}
\item{calendar_time}{Calendar time of event or censoring (enroll_time + tte)}
\item{event}{Binary indicator: 1 for event, 0 for censoring}
}
Multiple rows per subject are returned (one for each event, plus one for the final censoring time).
}
\description{
Simulates recurrent events for a clinical trial with piecewise constant enrollment,
exponential failure rates (Poisson process), and piecewise exponential dropout.
