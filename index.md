# nbDesign

nbDesign provides fixed design and group sequential design simulation
for recurrent event scenarios to be analyzed as a Poisson process or
negative binomial model. For group sequential design, the package can be
easily used with the gsDesign package. Key is the computation of
statistical information at the time of analysis.

## Code Style

This package follows the [tidyverse style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
