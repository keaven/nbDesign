# Changelog

## gsDesignNB 0.2.1

### Sample size and power

- [`sample_size_nbinom()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/sample_size_nbinom.md)
  computes sample size or power for fixed designs with two treatment
  groups. Supports piecewise accrual, exponential dropout, maximum
  follow-up, and event gaps. Implements the Zhu and Lakkis (2014) and
  Friede and Schmidli (2010) methods.

### Group sequential designs

- [`gsNBCalendar()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/gsNBCalendar.md)
  creates group sequential designs for negative binomial outcomes,
  optionally attaching calendar-time analysis schedules (via
  `analysis_times`) compatible with gsDesign. Inherits from both
  `gsDesign` and `sample_size_nbinom_result` classes.
- [`compute_info_at_time()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/compute_info_at_time.md)
  computes statistical information for the log rate ratio at a given
  analysis time, accounting for staggered enrollment.
- [`toInteger()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/toInteger.md)
  rounds sample sizes in a group sequential design to integers while
  respecting the randomization ratio.

### Simulation

- [`nb_sim()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/nb_sim.md)
  simulates recurrent events for trials with piecewise constant
  enrollment, exponential failure rates, and piecewise exponential
  dropout. Supports negative binomial overdispersion via gamma frailty
  and event gaps.
- [`nb_sim_seasonal()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/nb_sim_seasonal.md)
  simulates recurrent events where event rates vary by season (Spring,
  Summer, Fall, Winter).

### Interim data handling

- [`cut_data_by_date()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/cut_data_by_date.md)
  censors follow-up at a specified calendar time and aggregates events
  per subject, adjusting for event gaps.
- [`get_analysis_date()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/get_analysis_date.md)
  finds the calendar time at which a target event count is reached.
- [`cut_completers()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/cut_completers.md)
  subsets data to subjects randomized by a specified date.
- [`cut_date_for_completers()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/cut_date_for_completers.md)
  finds the calendar time at which a target number of subjects have
  completed their follow-up.

### Statistical inference

- [`mutze_test()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/mutze_test.md)
  fits a negative binomial (or Poisson) log-rate model and performs a
  Wald test for the treatment effect, following Mütze et al. (2019).

### Blinded sample size re-estimation

- [`blinded_ssr()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/blinded_ssr.md)
  estimates blinded dispersion and event rate from interim data and
  re-calculates sample size to maintain power, following Friede and
  Schmidli (2010).
- [`calculate_blinded_info()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesignNB/reference/calculate_blinded_info.md)
  estimates blinded statistical information for the log rate ratio from
  aggregated interim data.
