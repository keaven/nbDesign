# Sample size calculation for negative binomial distribution

Computes the sample size for comparing two treatment groups assuming a
negative binomial distribution for the outcome.

## Usage

``` r
sample_size_nbinom(
  lambda1,
  lambda2,
  dispersion,
  power = NULL,
  alpha = 0.025,
  sided = 1,
  ratio = 1,
  accrual_rate,
  accrual_duration,
  trial_duration,
  dropout_rate = 0,
  max_followup = NULL,
  event_gap = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- lambda1:

  Rate in group 1 (control).

- lambda2:

  Rate in group 2 (treatment).

- dispersion:

  Dispersion parameter `k` such that \\Var(Y) = \mu + k \mu^2\\. Note
  that this is equivalent to `1/size` in R's
  [`stats::rnbinom()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/NegBinomial.html)
  parameterization.

- power:

  Power of the test (1 - beta). Default is 0.9.

- alpha:

  Significance level. Default is 0.025.

- sided:

  One-sided or two-sided test. 1 for one-sided, 2 for two-sided. Default
  is 1.

- ratio:

  Allocation ratio n2/n1. Default is 1.

- accrual_rate:

  Vector of accrual rates (patients per unit time).

- accrual_duration:

  Vector of durations for each accrual rate. Must be same length as
  `accrual_rate`.

- trial_duration:

  Total planned duration of the trial.

- dropout_rate:

  Dropout rate (hazard rate). Default is 0. Can be a vector of length 2.

- max_followup:

  Maximum follow-up time for any patient. Default is NULL (infinite).

- event_gap:

  Gap duration after each event during which no new events are counted.
  Default is NULL (no gap). If provided, the effective event rate is
  reduced.

## Value

An object of class `sample_size_nbinom_result`, which is a list
containing:

- inputs:

  Named list of the original function arguments.

- n1:

  Sample size for group 1

- n2:

  Sample size for group 2

- n_total:

  Total sample size

- exposure:

  Average exposure time used in calculation (calendar time). Vector of
  length 2.

- exposure_at_risk_n1:

  Average at-risk exposure time for group 1 (accounts for event gap)

- exposure_at_risk_n2:

  Average at-risk exposure time for group 2 (accounts for event gap)
