This vignette demonstrates how to create a group sequential design for
negative binomial outcomes using `gsNBCalendar()` and simulate the design to confirm design operating characteristicsusing `nb_sim()`.

## Trial design parameters

We design a trial with the following characteristics:

* **Enrollment:** 12 months with a constant rate
* **Trial Duration:** 24 months
* **Analyses:**
  - Interim 1: 10 months
  - Interim 2: 18 months
  - Final: 24 months
* **Event Rates:**
  - Control: 0.125 events per month (1.5 per year)

  - Experimental: 0.0833 events per month (1.0 per year; rate ratio = 0.67)
* **Dispersion:** 0.5
* **Power:** 90% (beta = 0.1)
* **Alpha:** 0.025 (one-sided)

### Sample size calculation

First, we calculate the required sample size for a fixed design:

```{r sample-size}
# Sample size calculation
# Enrollment: constant rate over 12 months
# Trial duration: 24 months
event_gap_val <- 20 / 30.4375 # Minimum gap between events is 20 days (approx)

nb_ss <- sample_size_nbinom(
  lambda1 = 1.5 / 12, # Control event rate (per month)
  lambda2 = 1.0 / 12, # Experimental event rate (per month)
  dispersion = 0.5, # Overdispersion parameter
  power = 0.9, # 90% power
  alpha = 0.025, # One-sided alpha
  accrual_rate = 100 / 12, # Patients per month (will determine total n)
  accrual_duration = 12, # 12 months enrollment
  trial_duration = 24, # 24 months trial
  max_followup = 12, # 12 months of follow-up per patient
  dropout_rate = -log(0.95), # 5% dropout rate at 1 year
  event_gap = event_gap_val,
  method = "zhu" # Zhu and Lakkis sample size method
)

# Print key results
cat("Fixed design\n")
nb_ss
```

### Group sequential design

Now we convert this a group sequential design with 3 analyses after
10, 18 and 24 months.
Note that the final analysis time must be the same as for the fixed design.
The relative enrollment rates will be increased to increase the sample size
as with standard group sequential design theory.
We specify `usTime = c(0.1, 0.18, 1)` which along with the `sfLinear()` spending
function will spend 10%, 18% and 100% of the cumulative $\alpha$ at the 3
planned analyses regardless of the observed statistical information at each
analysis.

```{r gs-design}
# Analysis times (in months)
analysis_times <- c(10, 18, 24)

# Create group sequential design with integer sample sizes
gs_nb <- gsNBCalendar(
  x = nb_ss, # Input fixed design for negative binomial
  k = 3, # 3 analyses
  test.type = 4, # Two-sided asymmetric, non-binding futility
  sfu = sfLinear, # Linear spending function for upper bound
  sfupar = c(.5, .5), # Identity function
  sfl = sfHSD, # HSD spending for lower bound
  sflpar = -8, # Conservative futility bound
  usTime = c(.1, .18, 1), # Upper spending timing
  lsTime = NULL, # Spending based on information
  analysis_times = analysis_times # Calendar times in months
) |> gsDesignNB::toInteger() # Round to integer sample size
```

Textual group sequential design summary:

```{r}
summary(gs_nb)
```

Tabular summary:

```{r}
gs_nb |>
  gsDesign::gsBoundSummary(
    deltaname = "RR",
    logdelta = TRUE,
    Nname = "Information",
    timename = "Month",
    digits = 4,
    ddigits = 2
  ) |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(
    title = "Group Sequential Design Bounds for Negative Binomial Outcome",
    subtitle = paste0(
      "N = ", ceiling(gs_nb$n_total[gs_nb$k]),
      ", Expected events = ", round(gs_nb$nb_design$total_events, 1)
    )
  )
```



## Simulation study

We now simulate `r 50` trials to evaluate the power
of the group sequential design assuming design parameters above are correct.

### Simulation setup

```{r simulation-setup}
set.seed(42)
n_sims <- 50

# Enrollment rate (patients per month) to achieve target sample size
n_target <- ceiling(nb_ss$n_total)
enroll_rate_val <- n_target / 12 # All enrolled in 12 months

# Define enrollment
enroll_rate <- data.frame(
  rate = enroll_rate_val,
  duration = 12 # 12 months enrollment
)

# Define failure rates (with dispersion)
fail_rate <- data.frame(
  treatment = c("Control", "Experimental"),
  rate = c(1.5 / 12, 1.0 / 12),
  dispersion = c(0.5, 0.5)
)

# Dropout rate (5% at 1 year)
dropout_rate_val <- -log(0.95)
dropout_rate <- data.frame(
  treatment = c("Control", "Experimental"),
  rate = c(dropout_rate_val, dropout_rate_val),
  duration = c(100, 100) # Long duration
)

# Maximum follow-up (trial duration from enrollment start)
max_followup <- 12 # 12 months to match design
```

### Run simulations

### Events and exposure by analysis

```{r summary-events}
# Summarize by analysis
summary_by_analysis <- as.data.table(all_results)[
  ,

### Statistical information

The statistical information at each analysis is proportional to the precision
of the treatment effect estimate. For negative binomial outcomes, this relates
to the total exposure and event counts.

```{r info-summary}
# Summarize information (using blinded estimate from simulation)
info_by_analysis <- as.data.table(all_results)[
  ,
  .(
    mean_blinded = mean(blinded_info, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_unblinded = mean(unblinded_info, na.rm = TRUE)
  ),
  by = analysis
]

# Add planned information from design
info_by_analysis[, planned_info := gs_nb$n.I[analysis]]

# Normalize to get observed information fractions (relative to planned max)
max_planned_info <- tail(gs_nb$n.I, 1)
info_by_analysis[, observed_frac_blinded := mean_blinded / max_planned_info]
info_by_analysis[, observed_frac_unblinded := mean_unblinded / max_planned_info]
info_by_analysis[, planned_info_frac := planned_info / max_planned_info]

crossing_summary[, prob_cross_lower := n_cross_lower / n_sims]

# Cumulative power (Sim)

  ) |>
  fmt_number(columns = contains("power"), decimals = 3)
```

### Overall power

```{r overall-power}
# Determine if each simulation crossed the efficacy boundary at any analysis
efficacy_by_sim <- as.data.table(all_results)[
  ,
  .(efficacy = any(cross_upper, na.rm = TRUE)),
  by = sim

## Design summary

The `summary()` function provides a textual overview of the group sequential design:

```{r design-summary}
summary(gs_nb)
```

For detailed boundary information, use `gsBoundSummary()`. We set `logdelta = TRUE`
since the test statistic is based on the log rate ratio. The `~RR at bound` displays the
rate ratio ($\lambda_2/\lambda_1$), where values < 1 indicate treatment benefit:

```{r bounds-table}
gsDesign::gsBoundSummary(gs_nb,
  deltaname = "RR",
  logdelta = TRUE,
  Nname = "Information",
  timename = "Month",
  digits = 4,
  ddigits = 2
) |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(
    title = "Group Sequential Design Bounds for Negative Binomial Outcome",
    subtitle = paste0(
      "N = ", ceiling(gs_nb$n_total[gs_nb$k]),
      ", Expected events = ", round(gs_nb$nb_design$total_events, 1)
    )
  )
```

Note that `P(Cross) if RR=0.67` corresponds to the design's alternate hypothesis
(treatment rate / control rate = `r round(nb_ss$inputs$lambda2 / nb_ss$inputs$lambda1, 2)`).

Sample sizes at each analysis:

```{r sample-sizes}
data.frame(
  Analysis = 1:gs_nb$k,
  n1 = gs_nb$n1,
  n2 = gs_nb$n2,
  n_total = gs_nb$n_total
) |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(title = "Sample Sizes at Each Analysis") |>
  fmt_number(columns = c(n1, n2, n_total), decimals = 1)
```

After rounding to integer sample sizes with `toInteger()`:

```{r integer-design}
gs_nb_int <- toInteger(gs_nb)
summary(gs_nb_int)
```


## Notes

This simulation demonstrates the basic workflow for group sequential designs with
negative binomial outcomes:

1. **Sample size calculation** using `sample_size_nbinom()` for a fixed design
2. **Group sequential design** using `gsNBCalendar()` to add interim analyses
3. **Simulation** using `nb_sim()` to generate trial data
4. **Analysis** using `cut_data_by_date()` and `mutze_test()` at each interim
5. **Boundary checking** against the group sequential bounds

The `usTime = c(0.1, 0.2, 1)` specification provides conservative alpha spending
at early analyses, preserving most of the Type I error for later analyses when
more information is available.

With only `r n_sims` simulations, the estimated power has substantial Monte Carlo
error. For more precise estimates, increase `n_sims` to 1000 or more.
