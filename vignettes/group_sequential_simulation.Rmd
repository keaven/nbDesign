This vignette demonstrates how to create and simulate a group sequential design for 
negative binomial outcomes using `gsNBCalendar()`.

## Trial Design Parameters

We design a trial with the following characteristics:

* **Enrollment:** 1 year (12 months) with a constant rate
* **Trial Duration:** 2 years (24 months)
* **Analyses:**
  - Interim 1: 10 months
  - Interim 2: 18 months
  - Final: 24 months
* **Event Rates:**
  - Control: 1.5 events per year

  - Experimental: 1.0 events per year (rate ratio = 0.67)
* **Dispersion:** 0.5
* **Power:** 90% (beta = 0.1)
* **Alpha:** 0.025 (one-sided)

### Sample Size Calculation

First, we calculate the required sample size for a fixed design:

```{r sample-size}
# Sample size calculation
# Enrollment: constant rate over 1 year
# Trial duration: 2 years
nb_ss <- sample_size_nbinom(
  lambda1 = 1.5,          # Control event rate (per year)
  lambda2 = 1.0,          # Experimental event rate (per year)
  dispersion = 0.5,       # Overdispersion parameter
  power = 0.9,            # 90% power
  alpha = 0.025,          # One-sided alpha
  accrual_rate = 100,     # Patients per year (will determine total n)
  accrual_duration = 1,   # 1 year enrollment
  trial_duration = 2      # 2 year trial
)

# Print key results
cat("Fixed Design Sample Size:\n")
cat("  Control (n1):", ceiling(nb_ss$n1), "\n")
cat("  Experimental (n2):", ceiling(nb_ss$n2), "\n")
cat("  Total:", ceiling(nb_ss$n_total), "\n")
cat("  Average exposure:", round(nb_ss$exposure, 3), "years\n")
```

### Group Sequential Design

Now we create a group sequential design with 3 analyses. We use the `usTime` 
parameter to specify spending based on calendar time fractions:

* 10/24 ≈ 0.417 at interim 1
* 18/24 = 0.75 at interim 2
* 24/24 = 1.0 at final

However, the user specified `usTime = c(0.1, 0.2, 1)` which provides more 
conservative early spending.

```{r gs-design}
# Analysis times (in years, for simulation)
analysis_times <- c(10, 18, 24) / 12  # Convert months to years

# Information fractions (approximate, based on expected exposure)
# At 10 months: ~100 patients enrolled, avg follow-up ~5/12 years
# At 18 months: 100 patients enrolled, avg follow-up ~13/12 years
# At 24 months: 100 patients enrolled, avg follow-up ~1.5 years (final exposure)
# These are approximations; actual info depends on enrolled patients and events

# For timing, we use calendar time fractions
timing <- analysis_times / max(analysis_times)

# Create group sequential design
gs_nb <- gsNBCalendar(
  x = nb_ss,
  k = 3,
  test.type = 4,           # Two-sided asymmetric, non-binding futility
  timing = timing,
  usTime = c(0.1, 0.2, 1), # Conservative efficacy spending
  lsTime = NULL            # Futility spending based on information time
)

# Display design bounds
cat("\nGroup Sequential Design Boundaries:\n")
cat("\nAnalysis   Info Frac   Z Upper    Z Lower\n")
for (i in 1:3) {
  cat(sprintf("   %d        %.3f      %.3f      %.3f\n",
              i, gs_nb$timing[i], gs_nb$upper$bound[i], gs_nb$lower$bound[i]))
}

# Print the gsDesign object for full details
print(gs_nb)
```

## Simulation Study

We now simulate `r 50` trials to evaluate the operating characteristics 
of the group sequential design.

### Simulation Setup

```{r simulation-setup}
set.seed(42)
n_sims <- 50

# Enrollment rate (patients per year) to achieve target sample size
n_target <- ceiling(nb_ss$n_total)
enroll_rate_val <- n_target / 1  # All enrolled in 1 year

# Define enrollment
enroll_rate <- data.frame(
  rate = enroll_rate_val,
  duration = 1  # 1 year enrollment
)

# Define failure rates (with dispersion)
fail_rate <- data.frame(
  treatment = c("Control", "Experimental"),
  rate = c(1.5, 1.0),
  dispersion = c(0.5, 0.5)
)

# No dropout for simplicity
dropout_rate <- NULL

# Maximum follow-up (trial duration minus minimum enrollment time)
max_followup <- 2  # 2 years from enrollment start
```

### Run Simulations

```{r run-simulations}
# Storage for results
results <- vector("list", n_sims)

for (sim in 1:n_sims) {
  # Simulate trial data
  sim_data <- nb_sim(
    enroll_rate = enroll_rate,
    fail_rate = fail_rate,
    dropout_rate = dropout_rate,
    max_followup = max_followup,
    n = n_target
  )

    p_value = NA_real_,
    cross_upper = NA,
    cross_lower = NA
  )
  
  stopped <- FALSE
  
  for (k in 1:3) {
    if (stopped) {
      # Trial already stopped at earlier analysis
      sim_results$cross_upper[k] <- FALSE
      sim_results$cross_lower[k] <- FALSE
      next
    }
    
    # Cut data at analysis time
    cut_time <- analysis_times[k]
    cut_data <- cut_data_by_date(sim_data, cut_date = cut_time)
    
    # Count enrolled subjects (those with enroll_time <= cut_time)
    enrolled <- unique(sim_data$id[sim_data$enroll_time <= cut_time])
    cut_data <- cut_data[cut_data$id %in% enrolled, ]
    
    # Summary by treatment
    summary_dt <- as.data.table(cut_data)[
      ,
      .(n = .N, events = sum(events), exposure = sum(tte)),
      by = treatment
    ]
    
    ctrl_row <- summary_dt[treatment == "Control"]
    exp_row <- summary_dt[treatment == "Experimental"]
    
    sim_results$n_enrolled[k] <- nrow(cut_data)
    sim_results$events_ctrl[k] <- if (nrow(ctrl_row) > 0) ctrl_row$events else 0
    sim_results$events_exp[k] <- if (nrow(exp_row) > 0) exp_row$events else 0
    sim_results$events_total[k] <- sim_results$events_ctrl[k] + sim_results$events_exp[k]
    sim_results$exposure_ctrl[k] <- if (nrow(ctrl_row) > 0) ctrl_row$exposure else 0
    sim_results$exposure_exp[k] <- if (nrow(exp_row) > 0) exp_row$exposure else 0
    
    # Run Mütze test
    if (nrow(cut_data) >= 4 && sim_results$events_total[k] >= 2) {
      test_result <- tryCatch(
        mutze_test(cut_data),
        error = function(e) NULL
      )
      
      if (!is.null(test_result)) {
        sim_results$z_stat[k] <- test_result$z
        sim_results$p_value[k] <- test_result$p_value
        
        # Check boundaries (one-sided: reject if z < -upper bound for benefit)
        # For rate ratio < 1 (experimental better), log(RR) < 0, so z < 0
        z_eff <- -test_result$z  # Flip sign for efficacy direction
        
        sim_results$cross_upper[k] <- z_eff > gs_nb$upper$bound[k]
        sim_results$cross_lower[k] <- z_eff < gs_nb$lower$bound[k]
        
        if (sim_results$cross_upper[k] || sim_results$cross_lower[k]) {
          stopped <- TRUE
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  results[[sim]] <- sim_results
}

# Combine all results

```

## Results Summary

### Events and Exposure by Analysis

```{r summary-events}
# Summarize by analysis
summary_by_analysis <- as.data.table(all_results)[
  ,
  .(
    mean_enrolled = mean(n_enrolled, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_events_total = mean(events_total, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_events_ctrl = mean(events_ctrl, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_events_exp = mean(events_exp, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_exposure_ctrl = mean(exposure_ctrl, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_exposure_exp = mean(exposure_exp, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_z = mean(z_stat, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_z = sd(z_stat, na.rm = TRUE)
  ),
  by = .(analysis, analysis_time)
]

knitr::kable(
  summary_by_analysis,
  digits = 2,
  col.names = c("Analysis", "Time (yrs)", "N Enrolled", "Total Events",
                "Ctrl Events", "Exp Events", "Ctrl Exposure", "Exp Exposure",
                "Mean Z", "SD Z"),
  caption = "Summary Statistics by Analysis"
)
```

### Statistical Information

The statistical information at each analysis is proportional to the precision 
of the treatment effect estimate. For negative binomial outcomes, this relates 
to the total exposure and event counts.

```{r info-summary}
# Information proxy: inverse variance of log rate ratio
# For large samples: Var(log RR) ≈ 1/events_ctrl + 1/events_exp
info_by_analysis <- as.data.table(all_results)[
  ,
  .(
    mean_info = mean(1 / (1/events_ctrl + 1/events_exp), na.rm = TRUE),
    planned_info_frac = unique(gs_nb$timing[analysis])
  ),
  by = analysis
]

# Normalize to get observed information fractions
info_by_analysis[, observed_info_frac := mean_info / max(mean_info)]

knitr::kable(
  info_by_analysis,
  digits = 3,
  col.names = c("Analysis", "Mean Information", "Planned Info Frac", "Observed Info Frac"),
  caption = "Information by Analysis"
)
```

### Boundary Crossings and Power

```{r power-summary}
# Calculate crossing probabilities
crossing_summary <- as.data.table(all_results)[

  .(
    n_cross_upper = sum(cross_upper, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_cross_lower = sum(cross_lower, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_continue = sum(!cross_upper & !cross_lower, na.rm = TRUE)
  ),
  by = analysis
]

crossing_summary[, prob_cross_upper := n_cross_upper / n_sims]
crossing_summary[, prob_cross_lower := n_cross_lower / n_sims]

knitr::kable(
  crossing_summary[, .(analysis, n_cross_upper, prob_cross_upper, n_cross_lower, prob_cross_lower)],
  digits = 3,
  col.names = c("Analysis", "N Cross Upper", "P(Cross Upper)", "N Cross Lower", "P(Cross Lower)"),
  caption = "Boundary Crossing by Analysis"
)
```

### Overall Power

```{r overall-power}
# Determine if each simulation crossed the efficacy boundary at any analysis
efficacy_by_sim <- as.data.table(all_results)[
  ,
  .(efficacy = any(cross_upper, na.rm = TRUE)),
  by = sim
]

overall_power <- mean(efficacy_by_sim$efficacy, na.rm = TRUE)

# Futility stopping
futility_by_sim <- as.data.table(all_results)[
  ,
  .(futility = any(cross_lower, na.rm = TRUE) & !any(cross_upper, na.rm = TRUE)),
  by = sim
]

overall_futility <- mean(futility_by_sim$futility, na.rm = TRUE)

cat("\n=== Overall Operating Characteristics ===\n")
cat(sprintf("Number of simulations: %d\n", n_sims))
cat(sprintf("Overall Power (P[reject H0]): %.1f%%\n", overall_power * 100))
cat(sprintf("Futility Stopping Rate: %.1f%%\n", overall_futility * 100))
cat(sprintf("Design Power (target): %.1f%%\n", (1 - gs_nb$beta) * 100))
```

# Prepare data for plotting
plot_data <- all_results
plot_data$z_flipped <- -plot_data$z_stat  # Flip for efficacy direction

# Boundary data
bounds_df <- data.frame(
  analysis = 1:3,
  upper = gs_nb$upper$bound,
  lower = gs_nb$lower$bound
)

ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = factor(analysis), y = z_flipped)) +

## Notes

This simulation demonstrates the basic workflow for group sequential designs with 
negative binomial outcomes:

1. **Sample size calculation** using `sample_size_nbinom()` for a fixed design
2. **Group sequential design** using `gsNBCalendar()` to add interim analyses
3. **Simulation** using `nb_sim()` to generate trial data
4. **Analysis** using `cut_data_by_date()` and `mutze_test()` at each interim
5. **Boundary checking** against the group sequential bounds

The `usTime = c(0.1, 0.2, 1)` specification provides conservative alpha spending 
at early analyses, preserving most of the Type I error for later analyses when 
more information is available.

With only `r n_sims` simulations, the estimated power has substantial Monte Carlo 
error. For more precise estimates, increase `n_sims` to 1000 or more.
