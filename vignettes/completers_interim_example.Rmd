This vignette demonstrates how to simulate a group sequential design where an interim analysis is conducted based on a specific number of "completers" (subjects who have finished their follow-up).

## Simulation Setup

We define a trial with the following parameters:

*   **Sample Size:** 200 patients.
*   **Enrollment:** Recruited over 12 months.
*   **Follow-up:** 2 years maximum follow-up per patient.
*   **Interim Analysis:** Conducted when 40% of patients (80 subjects) have completed their 2-year follow-up. The interim analysis includes **only** these completers.
*   **Final Analysis:** Conducted when all patients have completed follow-up (or dropped out). Includes all available data (completers and partial follow-up).

```{r params}
# Parameters
n_total <- 200
enroll_duration <- 12 # months
max_followup <- 12 # months (using months as time unit for clarity)

# Convert to years if rates are annual, but let's stick to consistent units.
# Let's say rates are per YEAR, so we convert time to years.
# Time unit: Year
n_total <- 200
enroll_duration <- 1 # 1 year
max_followup <- 1 # 1 year

enroll_rate <- data.frame(
  rate = n_total / enroll_duration, 
  duration = enroll_duration
)

fail_rate <- data.frame(
  treatment = c("Control", "Experimental"),
  rate = c(0.5, 0.35) # Events per year
)

dropout_rate <- data.frame(
  treatment = c("Control", "Experimental"),
  rate = c(0.05, 0.05),
  duration = c(100, 100)
)
```

## Simulation Loop

We will simulate 50 trials. For each trial, we perform the interim and final analyses.

```{r simulation}
set.seed(2024)
n_sims <- 50
results <- data.frame(
  sim_id = integer(n_sims),
  interim_date = numeric(n_sims),
  interim_z = numeric(n_sims),
  interim_n = integer(n_sims),
  interim_info = numeric(n_sims),
  final_date = numeric(n_sims),
  final_z = numeric(n_sims),
  final_n = integer(n_sims),
  final_info = numeric(n_sims),
  info_frac = numeric(n_sims)
)

# Target completers for interim (40%)
target_completers <- 0.4 * n_total

for (i in 1:n_sims) {
  # 1. Simulate Trial Data
  sim_data <- nb_sim(
    enroll_rate = enroll_rate,
    fail_rate = fail_rate,
    dropout_rate = dropout_rate,
    max_followup = max_followup,
    n = n_total
  )
  
  # 2. Interim Analysis (Completers Only)
  # Find date when target_completers is reached
  date_interim <- cut_date_for_completers(sim_data, target_completers)
  
  # Cut data for completers at this date
  data_interim <- cut_completers(sim_data, date_interim)
  
  # Analyze (Mütze Test)
  res_interim <- mutze_test(data_interim)
  # Extract Z-statistic
  z_interim <- res_interim$z
  # Extract Information
  info_interim <- 1 / res_interim$se^2
  
  # 3. Final Analysis (All Data)
  # Date is when last patient completes (or max follow-up reached)
  # For final analysis, we use all data collected up to the end of the study.
  # The end of the study is when the last patient reaches max_followup.
  date_final <- max(sim_data$calendar_time)
  
  # Cut data at final date (includes partial follow-up for dropouts, full for completers)
  data_final <- cut_data_by_date(sim_data, date_final)
  
  res_final <- mutze_test(data_final)
  z_final <- res_final$z
  # Extract Information
  info_final <- 1 / res_final$se^2
  
  # Store results
  results$sim_id[i] <- i
  results$interim_date[i] <- date_interim
  results$interim_z[i] <- z_interim
  results$interim_n[i] <- nrow(data_interim)
  results$interim_info[i] <- info_interim
  results$final_date[i] <- date_final
  results$final_z[i] <- z_final
  results$final_n[i] <- nrow(data_final)
  results$final_info[i] <- info_final
  results$info_frac[i] <- info_interim / info_final
}
```

## Results Summary

We summarize the distribution of the test statistics (Z-scores) at the interim and final analyses.

```{r summary}
summary(results[, c("interim_date", "interim_z", "interim_info", "final_date", "final_z", "final_info", "info_frac")])
```

### Visualization

Comparison of Z-scores at Interim vs Final Analysis.

```{r plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
ggplot(results, aes(x = interim_z, y = final_z)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray") +
  labs(
    title = "Z-Scores: Interim vs Final Analysis",
    x = "Interim Z-Score (Completers Only)",
    y = "Final Z-Score (Full Data)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The plot shows the correlation between the interim statistic (based on 40% completers) and the final statistic.
